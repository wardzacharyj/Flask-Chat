Additional comments to the grader:

I struggled to interpret some of the requirements for this assignment particularly
'Users can be in only one chat room at a time'. In my mind I took this to mean that a user
could freely explore other chatrooms in another tab but as soon as they attempt to join a
room different from the one they are in they would be redirected to the newly selected room
across all tabs.
